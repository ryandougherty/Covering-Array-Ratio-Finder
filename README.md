# Covering-Array-Ratio-Finder

This finds all information on Covering Arrays from Charlie Colbourn's website (http://www.public.asu.edu/~ccolbou/src/tabby/catable.html), and constructs a Covering Array object. Then, it finds the ratio of the number of rows in each to v^t (the absolute minimum number of rows possible), and then prints the list in sorted ratio order.
